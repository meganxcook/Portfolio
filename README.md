Megan Cook | Junior Product Manager

Based in Vancouver, WA, US

**About**

Hi, I'm Megan Cook, a [PDX Code Guild](https://pdxcodeguild.com/) full stack bootcamp grad and early career product manager based in Vancouver, WA. I've been coding since early 2021 but my heart is in product management. 

I’ve been a midwife, a doula, a real estate agent, stay-at-home parent, clinical researcher, small business maven, server, and retail associate. So I guess you could say I come to tech from a non traditional background. In tech, and in the spirit of open source, I finally feel at home.

Clients and colleagues would describe me as a strong communicator, particularly skilled at collaborating with multiple stakeholders and translating complex challenges into actionable steps and win-win outcomes. Clients may share that I strive to deliver an exceptional client experience through active listening, informed choice, and managing expectations. Colleagues would tell you about my systematic and data-driven approach to every task, my attention to detail, my calm demeanor and optimistic outlook.

I’m super fired up about access to quality midwifery care and closing that maternal health care gap. I believe all people should thrive so I like to pair my programming skills with social justice. Need a programmer for the revolution?
