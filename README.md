Megan Cook | Coding Bootcamp Grad

Based in Vancouver, WA, US

**About**

Hi, I'm Megan Cook, a [PDX Code Guild](https://pdxcodeguild.com/) full stack bootcamp grad and early career implementation specialist based in Vancouver, WA. I've been coding since early 2021 and dreaming of a career in tech. I'm exploring pathways in project management and product management. 

I’ve been a midwife, a doula, a real estate agent, stay-at-home parent, clinical researcher, small business consultant, server, and retail associate. So I guess you could say I come to tech from a non traditional background. 

Clients and colleagues would describe me as a strong communicator, particularly skilled at collaborating with multiple stakeholders and translating complex challenges into actionable steps and win-win outcomes. Clients may share that I strive to deliver an exceptional client experience through active listening, informed choice, and managing expectations. Colleagues would tell you about my systematic and data-driven approach to every task, my attention to detail, my calm demeanor and optimistic outlook. In short, I'm coachable, empathetic, and hungry to learn. 

I get fired up about access to quality midwifery care and closing that maternal health care gap. I believe all people should thrive so I'd like to pair my tech skills with social justice. Seeking a comrade for the revolution?
