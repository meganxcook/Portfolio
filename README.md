Megan Cook | Coding Bootcamp Grad

Based in Vancouver, WA, US

**ABOUT**

Hi, I'm Megan Cook, a [PDX Code Guild](https://pdxcodeguild.com/) full stack development bootcamp grad and early career implementation specialist based in [Vancouver, WA](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Vancouver,+WA/@45.6381163,-122.6889994,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x5495af63c85914f9:0x8456d5112c91e3f3!8m2!3d45.6280277!4d-122.673865). I've been coding since early 2021 and actively pursuing a career in tech, exploring pathways in both product and project management.

I’ve been a midwife, doula, real estate agent, stay-at-home parent, clinical researcher, small business owner and consultant, server, and retail associate. So I guess you could say I come to tech from a non traditional background. 

***Clients and colleagues would describe me as a strong communicator, particularly skilled at collaborating with multiple stakeholders and translating complex challenges into actionable steps and win-win outcomes.***

Clients may share that I strive to deliver an exceptional client experience through active listening, informed choice, and managing expectations. Colleagues would tell you about my systematic and data-driven approach to every task, my attention to detail, my calm demeanor and optimistic outlook. 

***In short, I'm coachable, empathetic, and hungry to learn.***

I get fired up about access to quality midwifery care and closing that maternal health care gap. I believe all people should thrive so I like to pair my tech skills with social justice. Seeking a comrade for the revolution?
